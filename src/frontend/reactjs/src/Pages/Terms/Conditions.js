Terms and Conditions
AGREEMENT BETWEEN CUSTOMER AND LikeHome.COM, LP

Welcome to the LikeHome.com website (the "Website"). This Website is provided solely to assist customers in gathering travel information, determining the availability of travel-related goods and services, making legitimate reservations or otherwise transacting business with travel suppliers, and for no other purposes. The terms "we", "us", "our" and "LikeHome.com" refer to LikeHome.com, L.P., a Texas limited partnership and/or our subsidiaries. The term "you" refers to the customer visiting the Website and/or booking a reservation through us on this Website, or through our customer service agents.

This Website is offered to you conditioned upon your acceptance without modification of all the terms, conditions, and notices set forth below (collectively, the "Agreement"). Please read the Agreement carefully, as it contains important information about limitations of liability and resolution of disputes through arbitration rather than in court. You should also read our Privacy Policy, which also governs your use of the Website, and is incorporated by reference in this Agreement. By accessing or using this Website, booking any reservations for travel products or services, or contacting our call center agents, you agree that the Agreement then in force shall apply. If you do not agree to this Agreement, please do not use or book any reservations through this Website or our call center agents.

DISPUTES; ARBITRATION

LikeHome.com is committed to customer satisfaction, so if you have a problem or dispute, we will try to resolve your concerns. But if we are unsuccessful, you or we may pursue claims as explained in this section.
 
 
To give us an opportunity to resolve informally any disputes between you and us arising out of or relating in any way to the Website, this Agreement, our Privacy Policy, any services or products provided, any dealings with our customer service agents, or any representations made by us (“Claims”), you agree to communicate your Claim to LikeHome.com by contacting LikeHome.com Customer Support at http://service.LikeHome.com/app/home/locale/en_US or calling (877) 903-0071. You agree not to bring any suit or to initiate arbitration proceedings until 60 days after the date on which you communicated your Claim to Customer Support have elapsed. If we are not able to resolve your Claim within 60 days, you may seek relief through arbitration or in small claims court, as set forth below.
 
  
You and LikeHome.com agree that any and all Claims will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you and we may assert Claims on an individual basis in small claims court if they qualify. This includes any Claims you assert against us, our subsidiaries, travel suppliers or any companies offering products or services through us (which are beneficiaries of this arbitration agreement). This also includes any Claims that arose before you accepted this Agreement regardless of whether prior versions of the Agreement required arbitration.
 
 
 There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including statutory damages, attorneys’ fees and costs). The arbitrator must follow and enforce this Agreement.
 
  
Arbitrations will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA Consumer Rules. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules, except as provided in this section. If your total Claims seek less than $10,000, we will reimburse you for filing fees you pay to the AAA and will pay arbitrator’s fees.
 
 
Any and all proceedings to resolve Claims will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated, or representative action. The arbitrator will have authority to decide issues as to the scope of this arbitration agreement and the arbitrability of Claims. If for any reason a Claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, you and we each waive any right to a jury trial.
 
 
To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your Claims to “Code Monkeys Next Door Legal: Arbitration Claim Manager,” at Code Monkeys Next Door, Inc., 1111 Code Monkeys Next Door Group Way W., Seattle, WA 98119. If we request arbitration against you, we will give you notice at the email address or street address you have provided. The AAA's rules and filing instructions are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.
 
  
This arbitration agreement shall be governed by and enforced in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law. An arbitration decision may be confirmed by any court with competent jurisdiction.

PREPAID PROPERTY RESERVATIONS

You acknowledge that LikeHome.com pre-negotiates certain room rates with property suppliers to facilitate the booking of reservations on your behalf. The room rate displayed on the Website is a combination of the pre- negotiated room rate for rooms reserved on your behalf by LikeHome.com and the facilitation fee retained by LikeHome.com to compensate us for our services. You authorize LikeHome.com to book reservations for the total reservation price, which includes the room rate displayed on the Website, plus tax recovery charges, service fees, and where applicable, taxes on LikeHome.com’s services. You agree that your credit card will be charged by LikeHome.com for the total reservation price. Upon submitting your reservation request you authorize LikeHome.com to facilitate property reservations on your behalf, including making payment arrangements with property suppliers.

You acknowledge that, except as provided below with respect to tax obligations on the amounts we retain for our services, LikeHome.com does not collect taxes for remittance to applicable taxing authorities. The tax recovery charges on prepaid property transactions are a recovery of the estimated taxes (e.g. sales and use, occupancy, room tax, excise tax, value added tax, etc.) that LikeHome.com pays to the property supplier for taxes due on the property's rental rate for the room. The property suppliers invoice LikeHome.com for tax amounts. The property suppliers are responsible for remitting applicable taxes to the applicable taxing jurisdictions. LikeHome.com does not act as co-vendors with the supplier with whom we book or reserve our customer's travel arrangements. Taxability and the appropriate tax rate vary greatly by location. The actual tax amounts paid by LikeHome.com to the property suppliers may vary from the tax recovery charge amounts, depending upon the rates, taxability, etc. in effect at the time of the actual use of the property by our customers. We retain our fees as compensation in servicing your travel reservation. Our fees vary based on the amount and type of property reservation.

Sales, use and/or local property occupancy taxes are imposed on the amounts that we charge for our services (service fee and/or facilitation fee) in certain jurisdictions. The actual tax amounts on our services may vary depending on the rates in effect at the time of your property stay. 

PAY NOW ONLINE OR PAY LATER AT PROPERTY DETAILS

With certain properties, you may be presented with the option to pay online immediately or to pay later at the property itself. If you select the option to pay online immediately, you will be charged the amount in the currency that you select immediately. If you select to pay later at the property itself, the property will charge you in the local currency of the relevant property at the time of your stay. Tax rates and foreign exchange rates could change in the time between booking and stay. You shall provide the details of your payment card and the supplier or LikeHome.com will often have to verify: (i) the validity of the payment card (through a charge of a nominal value that is either refunded within a few days or deducted from the final payment due to the supplier) and, (ii) the availability of funds on the payment card (to be confirmed by the bank issuing your credit card). LikeHome.com reserves the right to cancel your booking if full payment is not received in a timely fashion (please see Supplier Rules and Restrictions).

Many bank and credit card companies charge their account holders a transaction fee when the card issuer and the merchant location (as defined by the card brand (e.g. Visa, MasterCard, American Express) are in different countries. The currency exchange rate, if applicable, and any transaction fee are determined solely by the bank or other agency processing the transaction. These fees may be applied by the card issuer as a charge to the cardholders account. This means the amount listed on your credit or debit card statement may be a different figure than the figure shown on the billing summary page for a reservation booked on this Website. If you have any questions about these fees or any exchange rate applied to your booking, please contact your bank.

PRICES

LikeHome.com® Rewards Terms & Conditions

LikeHome.com Rewards is a LikeHome.com loyalty program (the “Program”). For each night you book and stay at an eligible LikeHome.com Rewards property you collect one stamp (“Stamp”). When you collect 10 Stamps with us, we give you 1 reward night to redeem (“Reward Night”). This Reward Night does not include taxes and fees, which you must pay when redeeming your Reward Night.
  
All bookings must be made online or on our mobile app. You can only collect Stamps or redeem Reward Nights at an eligible LikeHome.com Rewards property.

The Program is open to anyone over 18 years old who signs up to LikeHome.com with a valid email address, and then joins the Program. Companies, associations, or other groups may not join. Employees of Code Monkeys Next Door, Inc. will not be able to collect Stamps or redeem Reward Nights if they make a booking through the B.E.S.T. program, or if they use an employee discount. If an Code Monkeys Next Door, Inc. employee makes a booking without using their discount, they will be able to collect Stamps and redeem LikeHome.com Rewards nights.

Collecting Stamps

You will collect 1 Stamp for every night you stay at an eligible LikeHome.com Rewards property. Collect 10 Stamps and we give you 1 Reward Night. You must be signed in to your LikeHome.com account when you book online and on our mobile app so we can add the Stamps you collect to your account after your stay. If you make a booking with us by phone, you must tell us the email address on your account so we know where to add the Stamps. Only LikeHome.com Rewards members collect Stamps. Other guests on the same booking do not, and you cannot collect Stamps for any property bookings you made before you joined the Program.

We will add any Stamps you collect to your account up to 72 hours after you check out of the LikeHome.com Rewards property. If you collect Stamps but we later believe that you did not complete your property stay (an “Invalid Stamp”), we reserve the right to remove these Invalid Stamps from your account. This could happen if you cancel your booking or did not check in at the property, which would make the Stamps invalid. Invalid Stamps do not count towards the 10 Stamps you need to redeem a Reward Night.

You can check your account to see how many Stamps you have collected at any time. Just sign in at LikeHome.com, use our mobile app, or phone our call center. You are responsible for making sure your account is correct. If you believe that you have not collected the correct amount of Stamps, we will look into this for you. If any bookings are invalid as mentioned earlier, we will remove them from your account.
In addition to the information above, you will not collect Stamps for the following:
1. Bookings made with an affiliate LikeHome.com site
2. Bookings made before you joined the Program
3. Package bookings i.e. property + flight
4. Some bookings made using a discount coupon, voucher or code – you will need to check the terms for each of these
5. Bookings made through Group Travel Services
6. Bookings that do not cost you anything, i.e. are free

Redeeming Reward Nights

When you collect 10 Stamps, we will give you 1 Reward Night to redeem at any eligible LikeHome.com Rewards property. You can redeem your Reward Night online and on our mobile app.

The maximum value of your Reward Night is based on the value of the 10 Stamps you collected as long as they have not expired. This value is equal to the average daily rate, excluding taxes and fees, of the Stamps you previously collected. If you collected a Stamp at a LikeHome.com Secret Price (defined below), this price rather than the regular price will be used for the purposes of the calculation. You must pay for taxes, fees, meals and any other costs associated with your Reward Night. 
 
 If you used different currencies when collecting your 10 Stamps, the value of each Stamp is currently calculated using the currency associated with the territory you were in when you joined the Program.

Reward Night stays are subject to all applicable booking terms and conditions. You will not collect a Stamp when you redeem your Reward Night. Collected Stamps have no cash value, and you cannot redeem your Reward Night for cash.
If you redeem your Reward Night on a stay that is less than the maximum value of your Reward Night, you will not get the difference in cash, credit or anything else. You can redeem your Reward Night on a stay that costs more than the maximum value of your Reward Night – you just pay the difference.

If you have more than 1 Reward Night to redeem, you can choose which booking you want to apply it to. You cannot combine your Reward Night with any other offer, discount coupon, voucher or code, unless the terms for each of these say you can. This means that when you book a stay and redeem your Reward Night, you generally will not be able to get an additional discount on that booking.
If you redeem your Reward Night on a booking that is longer than 1 night, we will automatically apply its value to the most expensive night in that booking, subject to its maximum value.

Reward Night stays are subject to all applicable cancellation policies that are passed onto us by the LikeHome.com Rewards property. If you cancel a Reward Night for which, had you paid for the night and cancelled it you would have been entitled to a full refund, we will return the Reward Night to your account.  If you cancel a Reward Night for which, had you paid for the night and cancelled it you would have been entitled to a 1-99% refund, the Reward Night will not be returned to your account.  If you cancel a Reward Night for which, had you paid for the night and cancelled it you would have not been entitled to any refund, the Reward Night will not be returned to your account.

If you want to change the dates of a booking that includes the Reward Night you redeemed, you will need to cancel the booking, wait for the Reward Night to be returned to your account, then rebook so you can apply your Reward Night to your new booking.

LikeHome.com Rewards tiers

The Program has 3 tiers: LikeHome.com Rewards, LikeHome.com Rewards Silver and LikeHome.com Rewards Gold. You will join as a LikeHome.com Rewards member. When you collect 10-29 Stamps in a membership year, you will qualify for LikeHome.com Rewards Silver. When you collect 30 Stamps or more in a membership year, you will qualify for LikeHome.com Rewards Gold. A membership year runs for a year from the date you first created an account, and each anniversary after that.
 
Silver and Gold members have a dedicated phone number they can call 24/7 to make or discuss their bookings. And there are other benefits like early sale access and exclusive offers. These will all be available within 2 weeks of qualifying for Silver or Gold, and will last for the rest of that membership year and the whole of the following membership year. If you do not collect enough Stamps to stay in Silver or Gold, we will move you down a tier for the next membership year.

Changes and Termination

Your Stamps will not expire as long as you keep your account active at least once every 12 months. This means you must collect a Stamp or redeem a Reward Night in that time, and when you do, the expiry date will be extended for another 12 months. If you do not collect Stamps or redeem Reward Nights in a 12 month period, your Stamps will expire and we may deactivate your account. If this happens, your Stamps will not be reissued. Sign into your account to check when your Stamps are due to expire.
 
 We may change our terms and conditions at any time, with or without notice, including the rules for collecting Stamps, the different membership tiers and their qualification requirements and associated benefits, the rules for redeeming your Reward Night, the list of eligible LikeHome.com Rewards properties, and the maximum value of a Reward Night. We may communicate these changes to you by email or on our LikeHome.com website so please make sure you check your account regularly.
LikeHome.com Rewards has no end date and will continue until we close it, which could happen at any time. If we do close the Program, you will have 30 days from when we announce its closure to redeem any Reward Nights you have in your account. After that date, you will lose your Reward Nights and you will not be compensated.
 
 By continuing to collect Stamps and redeem Reward Nights with LikeHome.com Rewards, you accept any changes to these terms and conditions. You are responsible for keeping up to date on any changes that we may make. The most current version will always be available on our website.

General LikeHome.com Rewards Terms & Conditions

We reserve the right to discontinue your membership if you act fraudulently or use our loyalty program in a way that does not comply with our terms and conditions, or any federal or state laws, regulations, statutes or ordinances. If we discontinue your membership, you may lose your collected Stamps and benefits. We also have the right to take appropriate administrative and/or legal action, including criminal prosecution if necessary.

•     	LikeHome.com Rewards members; and
 
•     	users of the Mobile Application (as defined in these terms and conditions below).
 
LikeHome.com Rewards members – If you are signed in to your LikeHome.com account when browsing the website, you will automatically be shown Secret Prices on selected properties where the "Your Secret Price" banner is displayed.
 
Mobile Application users – When using the Mobile Application, you will automatically be shown Secret Prices on selected properties where the "Your Secret Price" banner is displayed.

Where a Secret Price is displayed next to a price which has been stuck out (e.g. “$150 $100”), the struck-out price is based on the property’s standard rate on our site, as determined and supplied by the property. The "Prices" section of these terms and conditions will also apply to Secret Prices.

PRICE GUARANTEE TERMS

Price Guarantee - If you find a lower rate on LikeHome.com or on another website by 23:59 local time the day before your stay, we will offer you the difference. Package reservations are not eligible for this guarantee, and other terms and conditions apply, as per the below.

Submitting a Claim - 
• For non-refundable bookings: LikeHome.com will compensate you by issuing a coupon with a value corresponding to the price difference. The coupon can be used on a future booking on the LikeHome.com site. You must contact the customer call center or submit your request using the online Price Guarantee form by 23:59 local time the day before your stay. The room with the lower rate must be available for booking at the time you contact us, as determined by our customer service representatives. 
• For refundable bookings: 
a) Where the cheaper rate is found on LikeHome.com: You can either call the customer call center by 23:59 local time the day before your stay or cancel your existing booking online under Your Bookings when signed into your LikeHome.com account and rebook online at the cheaper price. If you call us, the room with the lower rate must be available for booking at the time you contact us, as determined by our customer service representatives. At your request, the customer service representative will rebook the room found at the lower rate using the payment details that you give on the phone. Your original booking will be cancelled by our customer service representative, and you will receive a refund for the price originally paid. Refunds will be processed by LikeHome.com immediately, but your bank can take up to 30 days to process the refund.
b) Where the cheaper rate is found on a competitor’s site: LikeHome.com will refund the price difference. You must contact the customer call center or submit your request using the online Price Guarantee form by 23:59 local time the day before your stay. The room with the lower rate must be available for booking at the time you contact us, as determined by our customer service representatives. Refunds will be processed by LikeHome.com upon verification of your request, but your bank can take up to 30 days to process the refund.

Comparison must be to same itinerary - The Price Guarantee is available only for exact itinerary matches, including property, room type, applicable cancellation policy, and dates of travel as booked through LikeHome.com. In addition, the comparison must be to the same property purchased stand-alone through another website. In other words, properties booked on another website as part of a package will not be eligible for the Price Guarantee. The Price Guarantee applies to the cost of booked travel, as presented on your booking confirmation, including any taxes and fees collected by us from you at the time of booking. The Price Guarantee does not apply to any taxes or fees collected by any third party from you, such as those taxes and fees a property may collect directly from you when you stay at the property. The Price Guarantee is not available for bookings on websites where the property or other booking details are unknown until after purchase. You must meet all requirements imposed on the lower price (if any), including, without limitation, residency, regional and age-related requirements.

Comparison must be available to the general public - The Price Guarantee applies only to prices both advertised and available to the general public. It also applies to our Secret Prices. The Price Guarantee does not apply to rates offered on competitors' membership program websites; corporate discounts or rates; group, charter, rewards program, incentive, meeting, convention, consolidator or interline prices; prices obtained via auction or similar process; or prices available only by using a coupon or other promotion not offered to the general public. The lower rate may not come from a website where you call to get the rate, or from an e-mail that you received. 

Claim Verification - All requests are subject to verification by LikeHome.com. We will not accept screenshots or other purported evidence of a lower price that we cannot independently confirm. Nor will we verify any request that we believe, in our sole discretion, is the result of a printing or other error or is made fraudulently or in bad faith. 

Refunds for Verified Requests (for refundable bookings only) - Verified refund requests will receive a credit to the card used for the reservation. Where you have paid for your property at the time of booking, we will send your refund upon verification of your request. Where you have chosen to pay for your LikeHome.com booking later at the property and you have found the cheaper price on another website, you must pay the property the original price upon arrival and we will send your refund after you have completed your stay. Note, any refunds may take up to 30 days or the next billing cycle to appear on your statement.

Coupons (for non-refundable bookings only) - Coupons will be sent to you by email immediately after your request has been made and verified by LikeHome.com. Coupon terms and conditions will apply (see above under ‘Conditions of use for discount codes’).

Changes - We reserve the right in our sole discretion to modify or discontinue the Price Guarantee or to restrict its availability to any person, at any time, for any or no reason, and without prior notice or liability to you. The terms that are in effect at the time of your booking will determine your eligibility under the Price Guarantee. Our failure to enforce any provision of these Terms & Conditions shall not constitute a waiver of that provision.
